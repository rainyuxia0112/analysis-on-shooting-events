# analysis-on-shooting-events
1) State heat map (# of shootings)
Demo : https://public.tableau.com/profile/rain7053#!/vizhome/shootingsummary/Stateheatmapofshootings?publish=yes
2) Do one-dimensional Plots
- Total victims, Fatalities, Injured
- Venue
- Prior signs of possible mental illness
- Race
- Gender
3) Use NLP method to draw wordcloud, finding keywords in the shooting and mental health descriptions

4) Interactive Barplots and Anova table
- total victims(break down:fatalities, injured) vs. year bar plots (chronological)
- total victims(break down:fatalities, injured) vs. weapon bar plots
- total victims(break down:fatalities, injured) vs. venue bar plots
- total victims(break down:fatalities, injured) vs. race of mental illness bar plots 
- total victims(break down:fatalities, injured) vs. gender of mental illness bar plots 

5) Regression Model - MLR => model selection
